# Uber Reimagined for the Elderly

Uber's mission to make transportation more accessible for all has prompted the exploration of our research question: “How to revolutionize the experience for the elderly population?”, specifically those aged 65 and above. 

The "Simple Mode" concept was developed as a user-centric solution to the pain points experienced by elderly users. One significant issue is that not all older people are technologically proficient or comfortable with smartphones. To overcome this gap, we use a simpler user interface that allows the elderly to easily utilize Uber's services.

Key Features of the Simple Mode include:
- 1-Click Away: A button to reduce the need for sophisticated app navigation, making it accessible to those with minimal digital literacy. Users may easily access regularly visited locations that have been bookmarked.
- Assistance: Allows users to choose special assistance during their journey.

A/B testing will be conducted between groups with versus without the Simple mode. To assess Simple Mode's success, we will largely look at the number of rides booked by adults aged 65 and up. User data will be thoroughly examined, and iterative design enhancements will be implemented in response to feedback and usage patterns detected.
